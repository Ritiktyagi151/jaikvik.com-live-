      title: "What is PPC Advertising?",

        <>
          What is PPC (Pay-Per-Click)? PPC is an online advertising model where
          advertisers pay only when their ad is clicked, driving targeted
          website visits. It’s effective for generating leads and sales by
          reaching users actively searching for relevant products or services.
          Advertisers bid on keywords to display ads during relevant searches,
          using tools like Google Keyword Planner for strategic keyword
          selection.
          <br />
          How PPC Works:
          <br />• Keyword Research: Identify relevant, high-volume,
          low-competition keywords.
          <br />• Ad Creation: Craft compelling ads with headlines, CTAs, and
          visuals.
          <br />• Bidding: Set max bids for clicks, determined by ad auctions.
          <br />• Ad Auction: Ads compete based on bid, relevance, and expected
          CTR.
          <br />• Cost Per Click (CPC): Pay only for clicks, often below max
          bid.
          <br />• Performance Tracking: Monitor impressions, clicks, CTR,
          conversions, and ROAS.

          Comparison between PPC, Meta, and YouTube Ads: Strengths and

          <br />• PPC: High-intent targeting, quick results, but costly for

          <br />• Meta: Advanced targeting, engaging formats, but faces privacy
          challenges and declining organic reach.
